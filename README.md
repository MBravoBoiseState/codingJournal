<sub>Brief Intro to Programming </sub>

#### Definitions
Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.  
Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.  
Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.  
Computational thinking: creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem. 
Algorithm: sequence of instructions that solves a problem. 
Syntax error: is to violate a programming language's rules on how symbols can be combined to create a program. A syntax error is known as a type of compile-time error.  
Logic error: also called a bug, is an error that occurs while a program runs. 


#### Concepts
When thinking about how programs will execute you'll want to think like you're analyzing a cooking recipe. Step by step. Increment by increment.   
The following code at the top of a file enables the program to get input: import java.util.Scanner;  
DON'T FORGET YOUR SEMICOLONS!!!   
A single-line comment starts with // and includes all the following text on that line. Single-line comments commonly appear after a statement on the same line.  
A multi-line comment starts with /* and ends with */, where all text between /* and */ is part of the comment. A multi-line comment is also known as a block comment.  
Work errors in order that you receive them (work top lines first). If you are not seeing an error in the referenced line, look at earlier lines within your code.
